## Data
This data set can be found on kaggle at this link
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/fastfood-nutrition)

## Goal
This project was spurred out of personal curiosity. I am interested in eating a protein dense diet. So if I am in a pinch and I need to eat at a fast food restaurant I want to know what foods to avoid and what foods to get. 

Additionally, I have heard the theory that salads are the least healthy item on a fast food menu. I would like to test that as well. This argument is specific to the large amounts of sugar in fast food salads

## Results
It was determined that Mcdonalds has the most unheathly menu with multiple menu items over 2,000 calories. 

Chick Fil-A has the best menu if you are looking to eat a protein dense diet. Specifically the grilled chicken nuggets, or any quantity, had the best protein to calorie ratio. 

An analysis on salad items could not be performed

## Next Steps/Improvements
Locate a data set that has information on salad items at fastfood restaurants an explore the nutrional values of those items.
